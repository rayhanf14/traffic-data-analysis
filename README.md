# 🚦 Traffic Congestion Prediction

This project predicts **traffic congestion levels (in percentage)** using real-world urban traffic indicators such as traffic volume, road capacity utilization, average speed, and incident reports. It demonstrates a **complete end-to-end machine learning workflow** — including data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, hyperparameter tuning, learning curve analysis, and feature importance evaluation.  

The project highlights how **data-driven modeling** can assist in **urban planning, traffic management, and congestion control strategies**.
